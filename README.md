## 🎯 The Project

### <p align="center">Santa Monica Rent Control Database</p>

> 📝 **Background**  
> The city of Santa Monica's Rent Control Board maintains a publicly accessible database of rent controlled properties in the city at https://www.smgov.net/departments/rentcontrol/mar.aspx
>
> The interface is very limited and only allows for looking up units in an individual building with an interface that leaves much to be desired.
>
> I have scraped the data using a python script and stored it in a CSV
> dataset which is stored locally in the root of this project.
>
> This project is aimed at bringing the data to life and allowing for better visualization, and more interaction with the data.
